# mobius_strip
CODE STRUCTURE

The MobiusStrip class is designed to be modular and reusable. It includes methods for:

-Computing parametric equations (parametric_equations)
-Generating a 3D mesh (compute_mesh)

-Approximating surface area (compute_surface_area)

-Calculating edge length (compute_edge_length)

-Visualizing the strip (plot)

The class is initialized with radius R, width w, and resolution n, and uses NumPy for efficient array operations and Matplotlib for visualization.

SURFACE AREA APPROXIMATION

The surface area is computed using numerical integration:

1.Partial derivatives of the parametric equations are calculated with respect to u and v.

2.The cross product of these derivatives gives the area element.

3.A Riemann sum approximation integrates the area element over the parameter domain [0, 2π] × [-w/2, w/2].
This method leverages the smoothness of the Möbius strip for accurate results.

CHALLENGES FACED

-Numerical Accuracy: Ensuring precise partial derivatives was critical for correct surface area computation.

-Edge Length: The edge length was approximated by summing Euclidean distances along the boundaries at v = ±w/2.

-Visualization: Adjusting Matplotlib parameters (e.g., transparency, figure size) was necessary for a clear 3D plot.

The generated plot is saved as mobius_strip.png.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT

For R=5, w=2, n=100:
-Surface Area: [value from script]
-Edge Length: [value from script]

Replace [value from script] with actual values from running mobius_strip.py if desired (e.g., run the script to get the surface area and edge length).
